#🌟 Next Word Prediction using LSTM and TensorFlow 🌟


Overview 📝
This repository contains code for building a next word prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset of text data and is capable of predicting the next word in a sequence of words.


Features 🚀
LSTM Architecture: The model uses a Bidirectional LSTM architecture, which allows it to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the input data.
Word Embeddings: The input data is converted into word embeddings using an Embedding layer, which helps the model learn the semantic relationships between words.
Tokenization and Padding: The input sequences are tokenized and padded to a fixed length to ensure uniformity in the input data.
Categorical Crossentropy Loss: The model is trained using the categorical crossentropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems.
Adam Optimizer: The model uses the Adam optimizer for training, which is an efficient and widely used optimization algorithm for deep learning models.
Word Cloud Visualization: The repository also includes code for generating a word cloud visualization of the input data, which can provide insights into the most frequent words in the dataset.
